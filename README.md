# SOL-X Assignment

## As a QA Engineer, how do you start your day?

1. Monitor daily Jenkins test execution reports 
2. Gather requirement specifications
3. Touch base with developers
4. Write test conditions and test cases (automation)
5. Run test cases (manual, automated or both)
6. Discover bugs and report
7. Retest

## Do you care about your fellow QA engineer developing the same automation code base? If yes, please describe the action while developing.

Yes, we do work in collaboration. but usually we work on different modules.
Since we work in teams there are instances where multiple people work on the same automation code base and it is inevitable 
We work on different branches for different requirements. 
We push our code to remote repository in regular interval so that the locally developed code is available to everyone for use.
If multiple people are working on the same branch we also keep updating our local repository with that of the remote to keep our local project updated. This in turn reduces conflicts later.
